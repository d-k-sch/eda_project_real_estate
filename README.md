# EDA Real Estate Project

In this project I will look at the King County real estate market to help my imaginary shareholder Amy Williams make good decisions about buying and selling houses. She owns several central top notch houses, which she would like to sell over time, in order to be able to afford buying a bunch of average houses in the outskirts, to hide from the FBI (did I mention Amy is part of the mafia?).

For a an overview of my results and methods, check out the presentation PDF, for more technical details, have a look at the Jupyter notebook.
